# A Simple Task Tracking Web-App created with REACT.JS

## Running the Application
1. First Update the React Dependencies used by running `npm install` in the project path from your terminal
2. Then you start the database "mock" server by running `npm run server` or if you have json server installed globally on your PC, you can just run `json-server --watch db.json --port 5000`
3. After the `json-server` is running successfully on port 5000, then you can go ahead to serve the application by running `npm start` or `npm run start`
4. Once everything everything is setup, the application should automatically start up on `localhost:3000` of your default browser and if it doesn't, just go to `localhost:3000` on your browser
